# PizzaSalesAnalysiswithSQL
This repository contains my SQL-based analysis of pizza sales data. Using SQL queries, I explored sales trends, customer preferences, and performance metrics to provide insights on revenue, popular pizzas, and sales patterns. The project highlights my SQL skills in data extraction, manipulation, and reporting for business analysis.
